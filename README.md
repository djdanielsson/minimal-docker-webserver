# docker-webserver-minal

make sure to download and install docker using these instructions and do not use
OS repo's cuz those don't always work correctly
https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux

to run this just use the command "sudo docker-compose up"

then go to a browser and type localhost:8080 and any webpages placed in www
folder should be accessable

Based off of https://github.com/devigner/docker-compose-php with the attempt to
run the minimal versions (alpine) when avalible.
